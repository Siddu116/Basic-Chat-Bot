# Basic-Chat-Bot
Basic Chatbot (Developed in Python)
The chatbot is a simple interactive program that simulates a conversation with the user. It processes input from the user and responds with predefined answers or logic-based replies.

How It Works:
The user types a message or question.
The chatbot interprets the input and responds based on preset keywords, patterns, or general conversation rules.
It engages in simple dialogues, answering common queries or responding with programmed phrases.
Technologies & Language:
This chatbot was built using Python due to its simplicity and ease of use. The core structure is designed using:

If-else statements to detect keywords or patterns in user input.
Basic string operations to analyze and process the conversation.
Optionally, the chatbot can be extended using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or spaCy for more advanced interactions.
Python's flexibility allows for rapid prototyping, making it an ideal choice for a beginner-friendly chatbot that can be expanded with additional features, such as learning new responses or maintaining conversation context.
